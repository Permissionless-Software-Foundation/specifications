- This document builds on top of the [SLP NFT 1 Protocol](https://github.com/simpleledger/slp-specifications/blob/master/slp-nft-1.md).

## 1. Introduction

The Simple Store Protocol (SSP) describes data structures for representing stores, products, and reviews on Bitcoin blockchains, by leveraging the OP_RETURN field of a transaction.

- Stores are represented as Group Tokens as per the [SLP NFT 1 Protocol](https://github.com/simpleledger/slp-specifications/blob/master/slp-nft-1.md), which in turn makes use of the [Lokad ID specification](https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/blob/master/spec/op_return-prefix-guideline.md).
- Products within the Store are described in mutable data for the Store NFT by following [PS002 Mutable Data protocol](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/specifications/blob/master/ps002-slp-mutable-data.md). Entries follow a JSON Linked-Data format, and whenever possible leverage existing [schema.org](https://schema.org/) taxonomy.
- *Claims* can represent store reviews, product reviews, metadata, or a Claim about other Claims. This is recorded in transaction, and also leverages the [Lokad ID specification](https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/blob/master/spec/op_return-prefix-guideline.md).
- An indexer similar to the [psf-slp-indexer](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/psf-slp-indexer) is used discover and track the above data as it is placed onto the blockchain.

## 2. Definitions

- **Stores** are the most fundamental data structure in the protocol. They represent an asset (like a business) which contains Products for sale. Their data structure is based on the [Store schema](https://schema.org/Store).
- **Products** are items listed for sale by the Store. Their data structure is based on the [Product schema](https://schema.org/Product).
- **Claims** are statements placed onto the blockchain, which are cryptographically signed by the originator. Claims can be product reviews, store reviews, metadata, or can refer to other Claims.
- **Customers** are users that purchase goods from a Store.

## 3. Stores

Stores are represented as a [SLP Group token](https://github.com/simpleledger/slp-specifications/blob/master/slp-nft-1.md). This allows the store to generate NFT tokens which can be used in a variety of ways: receipts, digital products, etc. They follow the [Store schema](https://schema.org/Store).

### Minimum Data

In order for a Group token to be recognized as a Store, it must meet these minimum data requirements:

- The `ticker` field of the [Group Genesis](https://github.com/simpleledger/slp-specifications/blob/master/slp-nft-1.md) transaction must start with the letters `SSP`. There can be additional characters of any kind after those first three.
- The `docuementUrl` field of the Group Genesis transaction should reference immutable data as per [PS002](./ps002-slp-mutable-data.md), which is a JSON document stored on the IPFS network. That data should be less than 1 megabyte in total size, and follow the [Store schema](https://schema.org/Store). The following minimum fields are required:

```
{
  "storeData": {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "Store"
  }
}
```

## 4. Products

Products only exist within the context of a Store. Their data structure is based on the [Product schema](https://schema.org/Product). The data for Products exists within the [mutable data](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/specifications/blob/master/ps002-slp-mutable-data.md) of the Store.


## 5. Claims

Claims are primarily used by Users to leave reviews about a Store or Product. However, Claims can reference other Claims. For example, a Store owner can generate a Claim to respond to a Claim generated by a User.

Claims are not tokens. Instead they are transactions on the blockchain that leverage the [Lokad ID specification](https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/blob/master/spec/op_return-prefix-guideline.md). Because they are transactions, they are cryptographically signed by the owner of a Bitcoin address (nonrepudiation), and once created, they immutable and uncensorable. Claims provide rich metadata about Stores, Products, and Users.
